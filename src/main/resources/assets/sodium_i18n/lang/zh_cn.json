There is generally no reason to disable this unless you're using incompatible mods.": "通过将有关如何渲染顶点数据的信息移动到驱动程序中来帮助提高性能，使其能够更好地优化相同对象的重复渲染。 除非你使用不兼容的模组，否则通常没有理由禁用此功能。",
  "Use Block Face Culling": "启用方块表面剔除",
  "If enabled, only the sides of blocks which are facing the camera will be submitted for rendering.

Some resource packs may have issues with this option, so try disabling it if you're seeing holes in blocks.": "启用后，将只会渲染面向镜头的方块表面。 这可以在渲染过程的早期剔除大量方块表面，从而节省GPU上的内存带宽和时间。 某些资源包可能会遇到此选项的问题，因此如果你看到方块显示不全，请尝试禁用它。",

  "Use Compact Vertex Format": "启用顶点压缩格式",
  "If enabled, a more compact vertex format will be used for rendering chunks. This can reduce graphics memory usage and bandwidth requirements significantly, especially for integrated graphics cards, but can cause z-fighting with some resource packs due to how it reduces the precision of position and texture coordinate attributes.": "启用顶点压缩格式",
  "Use Fog Occlusion": "启用迷雾遮挡",
  "If enabled, chunks which are determined to be fully hidden by fog effects will not be rendered, helping to improve performance. The improvement can be more dramatic when fog effects are heavier (such as while underwater), but it may cause undesirable visual artifacts between the sky and fog in some scenarios.": "启用后，被迷雾效果完全隐藏的区块将不会被渲染，有助于提高性能。 当迷雾效果较重时（例如在水下时），改进可能会更加显着，但在某些情况下可能会导致天空和雾之间出现不良的视觉伪影。",

  "If enabled, entities determined not to be in any visible chunks will be skipped during rendering. This can help improve performance by avoiding the rendering of entities located underground or behind walls.": "启用后，则在渲染期间跳过在不可见区块的实体。 这可以通过避免渲染位于地下或墙后的实体来帮助提高性能。",
  "If enabled, a secondary culling pass will be performed before attempting to render an entity. This additional pass takes into account the current set of visible chunks and removes entities which are not in any visible chunks.": "启用后，将在尝试渲染实体之前执行第二次剔除。这一额外流程将会考虑到当前可见区块的范围，然后剔除不在可见区块范围内的实体。",
  "Use Particle Culling": "启用颗粒剔除",
  "If enabled, only particles which are determined to be visible will be rendered. This can provide a significant improvement to frame rates when many particles are nearby.": "启用后，将仅渲染可见的颗粒。当周围有许多颗粒时，这可以显著地提高帧率。",
  "Animate Only Visible Textures": "仅渲染可见的动态材质",
  "Allow Direct Memory Access": "允许直接访问内存",
  "If enabled, some critical code paths will be allowed to use direct memory access for performance. This often greatly reduces CPU overhead for chunk and entity rendering, but can make it harder to diagnose some bugs and crashes. You should only disable this if you've been asked to or otherwise know what you're doing.": "启用后，将允许某些关键代码使用路径直接访问内存来提高性能。 这通常会大大降低区块和实体渲染的CPU性能，但会使诊断某些错误和崩溃变得更加困难。 如果你被要求或以其他方式知道您在做什么，你应该只禁用它。",
  "If enabled, only animated textures determined to be visible will be updated. This can provide a significant boost to frame rates on some hardware, especially with heavier resource packs. If you experience issues with some textures not being animated, try disabling this option.": "启用后，只会更新可见的动态材质。这可以大大提高某些硬件的帧率，尤其是对于较大的资源包。如果遇到某些材质无动画的问题，请禁用此选项。",
  "Use Memory Intrinsics": "对内存使用内置函数",

  "Disable Driver Blacklist": "禁用驱动程序黑名单",
  "If selected, Sodium will ignore the built-in driver blacklist and enable options which are known to be broken with your system configuration.
